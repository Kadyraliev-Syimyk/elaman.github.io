1. Welcome

I'm Elaman Imashov, software developer, working in web development. If you have a project that needs some creative injection then thatâ€™s where I come in! 

My job is to build your website so that it is functional and user-friendly but at the same time attractive. Moreover, I add personal touch to your product and make sure that is eye-catching and easy to use. My aim is to bring across your message and identity in the most creative way.
